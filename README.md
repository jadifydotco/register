### NS records
When applying for NS records, please consider if you *actually* need them. Please provide a detailed reason (with evidence) of why you require NS records.

9 times out of 10, you do not actually need NS records, and merely want them. We already support a wide range of records, so it is extremely unlikely you will actually require them.

Pull requests adding NS records without reasoning will be closed instantly.
